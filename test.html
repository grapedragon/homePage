        <h1> Re-learning some things</h1>
        <p>This is me practicing some old fashion HTML hand coding and learning about a number of programs. And while <b>Visual</b> Studio code is kinda intense, I do like sublime I feel like I can do more with VSC. I will also say I am in love with the Guthub desktop - <i>yeah</i> maybe durring a project I probably won't use it I like that I can use it no matter the program I use so maybe I can use it with Obisan or some other programs. </p> <br> 
        <p> Maybe I do the auto <b>overwrite</b> option for the text </p>
